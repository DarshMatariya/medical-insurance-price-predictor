# Medical Insurance Price Predictor

Predict a personâ€™s annual medical insurance charges using demographic and lifestyle features through a supervised machine learning model.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the medical insurance cost for individuals based on attributes like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and a Random Forest Regressor was used to model the relationships between features and cost.

## Repository Structure

- `notebook/`: Contains the complete Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
- `dataset/`: Includes a text file with dataset source and feature details. Dataset not uploaded due to size.
- `results/`: Holds the prediction plot (actual vs predicted) and model evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²).

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Medical Cost Personal Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Features**:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - BMI
  - Number of Children
  - Smoker (Yes/No)
  - Region
  - Charges (Target)

## Workflow Overview

- Handle missing/duplicate entries
- Encode categorical variables
- Apply scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Log-transform the `charges` column
- Train `RandomForestRegressor`
- Visualize results and performance metrics
